Adhering closely to the guidelines stated between <guidelines> tags
review all ci stages in the jenkins file presented between <file_to_translate> tags
and translate to .gitlab-ci.yml file.

<guidelines>
1. Jenkins pipelines execute on agents, the agent section defines how the pipeline executes, and the Docker container
to use. GitLab jobs execute on runners, and the image keyword defines the container to use.
2. Jenkins post section defines actions that should be performed at the end of a stage or pipeline.
In GitLab, use after_script for commands to run at the end of a job, and before_script for actions to run
before the other commands in a job. Use stage to select the exact stage a job should run in.
GitLab supports both .pre and .post stages that always run before or after all other defined stages.
3. Map Jenkins triggers to Gitlab rules
4. Map Jenkins stages to GitLab stages
5. Transform Jenkins environment variables to GitLab variables
6. Translate Jenkins credential handling to GitLab's secrets management
7. Map Jenkins artifacts to GitLab artifacts with proper paths and expiration
8. Convert Jenkins steps blocks to GitLab script sections
9. Convert Jenkins agents/nodes to GitLab runners and tags
10. Translate Jenkins conditionals to GitLab's rules or only/except
11. In Jenkins, tools defines additional tools to install in the environment. GitLab does not have a similar keyword,
use container images prebuilt with the exact tools required for your jobs. These images can be cached and can be built
to already contain the tools you need for your pipelines. If a job needs additional tools, they can be installed as
part of a before_script section.
12. Jenkins has input and parameters when triggering a pipeline. Use Gitlab CI/CD variables for the same.
13. Always ensure your GitLab CI YAML is syntactically valid. If the linter reports errors, fix them.
</guidelines>

Analyse provided Jenkins files and outline necessary steps in order to translate it to gitlab CI yml file:
{%- for added_context in additional_context %}
{%- if added_context.category == "file" %}
<file_to_translate>
{{added_context.content}}
</file_to_translate>
{%- endif %}
{%- endfor %}

Please prepare all necessary 'create_file_with_contents' tool calls to apply all <guideline> requirements.
For each file, include:
1. The full filepath and filename
2. Complete file contents

If there are subcomponents within the jenkins environment that require loading repository files using relative paths,
use `read_file` tool to read the subcomponents first before proceeding further.

After creating the .gitlab-ci.yml file, I'll validate it with GitLab's CI linter to ensure it meets all syntax requirements.
If any issues are found, you'll need to fix them and create an updated version.

{% if project %}Note: The project_id for ci_linter validation is {{project.id}}.{% endif %}
