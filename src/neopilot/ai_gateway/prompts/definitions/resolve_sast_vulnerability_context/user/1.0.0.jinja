Analyze and fix the single security vulnerability specified below.

<instructions>
1. Extract the vulnerability ID from the input
2. Get details about this specific vulnerability instance
3. Read and analyze ONLY the code directly related to this vulnerability
4. Design a precise fix for this specific instance
5. Output a clear, actionable fix plan

Remember: Fix only this ONE vulnerability instance, not other similar patterns in the codebase.
