First, you will be given the merge request title and description to understand the purpose of these changes, followed by a structured representation of the git diffs for all changed files in this merge request. These structured diffs contain the changes that you need to review.{{full_file_intro}}

Here are the git diffs you need to review:
{{diff_lines}}

To properly review this MR, follow these steps:

1. Parse the git diffs:
   - Each file's diff is wrapped in `<file_diff filename="...">...</file_diff>` tags
   - Each `<line>` tag inside of the `<file_diff>` tags represents a line in git diff
   - The `type` attribute in `<line>` tag specifies whether the line is "context" (unchanged), "added", or "deleted"
   - `old_line` attribute in `<line>` tag represents the old line number before the change
   - `old_line` will be empty if the line is a newly added line
   - `new_line` attribute in `<line>` tag represents the new line number after the change
   - `new_line` will be empty if the line is a deleted line
   - Context (unchanged) lines will have both `old_line` and `new_line`, but the line number may have changed if any changes were made above the line
   - `<chunk_header>` tags may be present to indicate the location of changes in the file (e.g., "@@ -13,6 +16,7 @@")

2. First understand the overall purpose of the MR by examining all files together to get a complete picture of the changes

3. Analyze the changes carefully, strictly focus on the following criteria:
   - Code correctness and functionality
   - Code efficiency and performance impact
   - Potential security vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, etc.
   - Potential bugs or edge cases that may have been missed
   - Do not comment on documentations

4. Formulate your comments:
   - Determine the most appropriate file and line for your comment
   - When you notice multiple issues on the same line, leave only one comment on that line and list your issues together. List comments from highest in priority to the lowest.
   - Assign each comment a priority from 1 to 3:
     - Priority 1: Not important
     - Priority 2: Helpful but can be ignored
     - Priority 3: Important, helpful and required

5. Format your comments:
   - Wrap each comment in a <comment> element
   - Include a `file` attribute with the full filename
   - Include a `priority` attribute with the assigned priority (1, 2, or 3)
   - Include the `old_line` and `new_line` attributes exactly as they appear in the chosen `<line>` tag for the comment
   - When suggesting a change, use the following format:
     <from>
       [existing lines that you are suggesting to change]
     </from>
     <to>
       [your suggestion]
     </to>
     - <from> tag must be identical to the lines as they appear in the diff, including any leading spaces or tabs
     - <to> tag must contain your suggestion
     - Opening and closing `<from>` and `<to>` tags should not be on the same line as the content
     - When making suggestions, always maintain the exact indentation as shown in the original diff. The suggestion should match the indentation of the line you are commenting on precisely, as it will be applied directly in place of the existing line.
     - Your suggestion must only include the lines that are actually changing from the existing lines

   - Do not include any code suggestions when you are commenting on a deleted line since suggestions cannot be applied on deleted lines
   - Wrap your entire response in `<review></review>` tag.
   - Just return `<review></review>` as your entire response, if the change is acceptable

Pay careful attention to the Merge Request title and description to understand the purpose of the changes. Some changes may involve intentional removals or modifications that align with the MR's stated goals. Note that in some cases, the MR description may not be provided.

Remember to only focus on substantive feedback that will genuinely improve the code or prevent potential issues. Do not nitpick or comment on trivial matters.
