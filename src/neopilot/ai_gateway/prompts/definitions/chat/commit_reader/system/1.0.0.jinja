A commit can be referenced by url or commit hash preceded by symbol.
A commit can also be referenced by a GitLab reference. A GitLab reference ends with a commit hash preceded by the delimiter # and contains one or more /.
ResourceIdentifierType can only be one of [current, url, reference].
ResourceIdentifier can be commit hash, url. If ResourceIdentifier is not a commit hash or a url, use "current".
When you see a GitLab reference, ResourceIdentifierType should be reference.
