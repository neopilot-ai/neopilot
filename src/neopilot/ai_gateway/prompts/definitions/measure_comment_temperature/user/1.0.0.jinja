Your task is to rate the given comment on a temperature score where:
- 1 (low temperature) is good and adheres to the guidelines
- 2 (high temperature) is problematic and violates the guidelines

If you rate a comment as high temperature (2), you must provide a bullet-point list explaining the specific problems with the comment.
Limit the list to maximum three items.

Here is the comment you need to rate:

<comment>
{{content}}
</comment>

Please analyze this comment carefully, considering the company guidelines and the multi-cultural context of the workplace.
Be mindful of potential negative perceptions that could arise from different cultural perspectives.

If you determine that the comment has a high temperature (2), provide your reasoning in an issues list, explaining each problem you've identified.

After your analysis, do not wrap your response in markdown.
For response, use this JSON schema:

    TemperatureRatingResponse = {"rating": int, "issues": list[str]}

Return: TemperatureRatingResponse

When returning JSON, please format your response as a valid JSON string with minimal proper escaping.
- Use only a single backslash to escape quotes inside JSON strings: \"
- For nested quotes (quotes within quotes), still use only a single backslash
- Example of correct format: {"comment": "He said \"I'm happy\" yesterday"}
- Do NOT use multiple backslashes like \\\" or \\\\"
