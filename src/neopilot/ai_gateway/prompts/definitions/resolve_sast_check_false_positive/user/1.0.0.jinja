Analyze the merge request to determine if it contains actual security fixes or if the vulnerability was a false positive.

<analysis_steps>
1. **Extract Merge Request URL**
   Search git_operations_result for the MR URL.
   Common patterns:
   - "remote: https://gitlab.com/.../merge_requests/123"
   - "remote: View merge request for..."
   - Look for any URL containing "merge_requests"

   If not found, construct using:
   {{repository_url}}/-/merge_requests/security%2Fsast-fix-<ID>-{{workflow_id}}

   Extract the vulnerability ID from the vulnerability_context.

2. **Fetch and Analyze MR Diffs**
   Use list_merge_request_diffs with the extracted URL to get the actual changes.

   After receiving the diff results, reflect on what you've learned:
   - Are the diffs complete and properly formatted?
   - Do you have enough information to make a confident determination?
   - Is anything unexpected or unclear that requires additional investigation?

   Then examine the diffs carefully:
   - Count the number of files changed
   - Check if changes are meaningful (not just whitespace/comments)
   - Verify if changes address the security vulnerability

3. **Determine False Positive Status**
   Consider it a false positive if:
   - No diffs exist (empty MR)
   - Only whitespace/comment changes exist
   - No code changes that could address the reported vulnerability

   Parse vulnerability_context to understand what vulnerability was reported
   and verify whether the changes (if any) actually address it.

4. **Mark False Positive MRs**
   If determined to be a false positive (empty or trivial changes):

   **Action A:** Add a comment using create_merge_request_note:
   ```
   **Potential False Positive Detected**

   This merge request was created by the automated SAST vulnerability resolution workflow, but no code changes were necessary to address the reported vulnerability.

   **Possible reasons:**
   - The vulnerability was a false positive from the SAST scanner
   - The code pattern flagged is not actually exploitable in this context
   - The vulnerability was already fixed in a previous commit

   **Recommendation:** Please review the original vulnerability report and close this MR if the finding was indeed a false positive.
   ```

   **Action B:** Update the MR title using update_merge_request:
   Prepend "[Possible False Positive] " to the existing title

   **Action C:** Add a label or update description if needed (optional)

5. **Output Result**
   Your final_answer MUST be a valid JSON object with this structure:
   ```json
   {
     "is_false_positive": true,
     "has_code_changes": false,
     "merge_request_url": "https://gitlab.com/org/project/-/merge_requests/123",
     "action_taken": "added_comment_and_updated_title",
     "files_changed": 0,
     "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this was marked as false positive"
   }
   ```

   If it's NOT a false positive:
   ```json
   {
     "is_false_positive": false,
     "has_code_changes": true,
     "merge_request_url": "https://gitlab.com/org/project/-/merge_requests/123",
     "action_taken": "no_action_needed",
     "files_changed": 5,
     "reasoning": "MR contains meaningful security fixes"
   }
   ```
</analysis_steps>

<critical_requirements>
- ALWAYS fetch the MR diffs before making a determination
- Be conservative: if uncertain, do NOT mark as false positive
- Always include the merge_request_url in your response
- Your final_answer will be parsed by automated security systems, so it MUST be:
   - Valid JSON with no syntax errors
   - NO additional text before the opening {
   - NO additional text after the closing }
   - NO explanatory comments or markdown formatting
</critical_requirements>
